## Understanding the Spring Petclinic application with a few diagrams

[See the presentation here](https://speakerdeck.com/michaelisvy/spring-petclinic-sample-application)

## Run Petclinic locally

Spring Petclinic is a [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot) application built using [Maven](https://spring.io/guides/gs/maven/) or [Gradle](https://spring.io/guides/gs/gradle/). You can build a jar file and run it from the command line (it should work just as well with Java 17 or newer):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hangwan97/petclinic_new.git
cd petclinic_new
./mvnw package
java -jar target/*.jar
```

(On Windows, or if your shell doesn't expand the glob, you might need to specify the JAR file name explicitly on the command line at the end there.)

You can then access the Petclinic at <http://localhost:8080/>.

Or you can run it from Maven directly using the Spring Boot Maven plugin. If you do this, it will pick up changes that you make in the project immediately (changes to Java source files require a compile as well - most people use an IDE for this):

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

> NOTE: If you prefer to use Gradle, you can build the app using `./gradlew build` and look for the jar file in `build/libs`.

## Building a Container

There is no `Dockerfile` in this project. You can build a container image (if you have a docker daemon) using the Spring Boot build plugin:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:build-image
```

Our issue tracker is available [here](https://github.com/hangwan97/petclinic_new/issues).

## Database configuration

In its default configuration, Petclinic uses an in-memory database (H2) which
gets populated at startup with data. The h2 console is exposed at `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`,
and it is possible to inspect the content of the database using the `jdbc:h2:mem:<uuid>` URL. The UUID is printed at startup to the console.

### MySQL, PostgreSQL

You can also use MySQL or PostgreSQL databases. Database settings are located in `application-mysql.properties` and `application-postgres.properties` in the `src/main/resources` directory.

1. Run the application with `./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=mysql` for MySQL or `./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=postgres` for PostgreSQL.

For more details on using these databases, please refer to the documentation.
